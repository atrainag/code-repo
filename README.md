# code-repo
All of my codes that I wrote when I was in High School and College.

My main is `C++` and `Python`.
But I still can read other languages such as ~~Japanese~~ Java or Js alike i guess :>
My math skills are Average so most of the code is going to be just using math rather than loops cuz i am lazy _lmao_
## NOTE:
Most of them are inefficient and slow.
Because I always depend on brute force first and then I try to think of a better solution. But i always believe the first step to the most efficient solution is to make the worst solution and slowly improve it. Nothing starts perfect.

> ***<sup>says the person who never improve their solution when its AC</sup>***

Feel free to look and comment on my code if you feel like you had to.
