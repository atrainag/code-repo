# code-repo
All of my codes that I wrote when I was in High School and College.

# Yes all of them 
I guess

**LMAO**

## NOTE:
Most of them are inefficient and slow.
Because I always depend on brute force first and then I try to think of a better solution. But i always believe the first step to the most efficient solution is to make the worst solution and slowly improve it. Nothing starts perfect.

**says the person who never improve their solution when its AC**
